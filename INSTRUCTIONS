## Pre-Test exercise
## Follow the instructions in order.
## Each instruction point allocates a maximum of marks, indicated in 
## square brackets, [X]. Marks are allocated following clear, correct,
## and effective coding. Originality and creativity are especially
## valued to achieve higher marks. The maximum grade for this exercise
## is 100.
##
## The current directory was cloned by your fork of jfoadi/PreTest.
## It includes an incomplete Python package, "cluster_maker", and
## an incomplete test file, "test_cm.py". The repository also includes
## the instructions you are reading now, "INSTRUCTIONS".
##
## Carry out the following tasks, one after the other, following 
## the numeric order. So you should attempt following instruction 2
## only after completing instruction 1, and so on.
##
## 1) Modify the package in order to make "test_cm.py" run successfully.
##    [20]
## 2) Try and understand what the function define_dataframe_structure()
##    does and write an appropriate, human-readable, docstring for it.
##    [10]
## 3) Try and understand what the function simulate_data() does and
##    write an appropriate, human-readable, docstring for it.
##    [10]
## 4) Write a demo file, called "demo1_cm.py", that demonstrate
##    the use of the three functions of the package. The type of
##    demonstration is up to you, but it should be clear and 
##    informative. 
##    [10]
## 5) Add to "data_exporter.py" a function called export_formatted()
##    that exports the data created to a formatted text file. The
##    formatting should make the file human-readable and informative.
##    [20]
## 6) Add a function, called non-globular_cluster(), to 
##    dataframe_builder.py, that tries to simulate non-globular
##    clusters. Similarly to simulate_data(), this function should
##    take the seed data structure (the dataframe created by 
##    define_dataframe_structure()) and the number of points to
##    simulate, but also whatever parameters you think are necessary.
